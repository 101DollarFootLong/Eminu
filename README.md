# Eminu
The “Eminu” is a *concept* application that aims to help people find the best restaurant based on the user’s price range and other specifications like rating, location distance, type of food, and other personal food caveats. The application has the ability to display the menu, reservation, and detailed information about the selected restaurant. Our goal is to have the most accurate and up to date information. For this, any restaurant can provide their information using a web-portal. The administrator will have the ability to verify the accuracy of the information, the restaurant’s owners and the user’s information. Eminu requires the use of internet and location service to fetch the data to the database. The software can interact with the user’s phone GPS-Navigator, which allows the user to view the desired restaurant and navigates to it.
